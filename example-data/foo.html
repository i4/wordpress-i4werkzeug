<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One of the more popular versions of the song is: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Little Bunny Foo Foo, <br />
		Hopping through the forest,<br />
		Scooping up the field mice, <br />
		And bopping them on the head.<br />
		<br />
		(Spoken) <br />
		<i>Down came the Good Fairy, and she said,</i><br />
		<br />
		"Little Bunny Foo Foo,<br />
		I don't want to see you,<br />
		Scooping up the field mice<br />
		And bopping them on the head."<br />
		<br />
		(Spoken)<br />
		"<i>I'll give you three chances,</i><br />
		<i>And if you don't behave,</i><br />
		<i>I'm gonna turn you into a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/goon" title="goon">goon</a>!</i>"<br />
		<br />
		<i>The next day...</i> or <i>That evening...</i> or <i>Later that night...</i>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verses then repeat three more times, with the spoken verse altered to reflect Little Bunny Foo Foo's decreasing number of chances. The alteration appears in the first line of the verse, which changes to "I'll give you two more chances" and "I'll give you one more chance", in the second and third iterations, respectively.</p>
<p>In the fourth and final iteration, when the bunny has run out of chances, the entire spoken verse is altered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>"<i>I gave you three chances,</i> <br />
		<i>And you didn't behave,</i><br />
		<i>And now I'm gonna turn you into a goon. POOF!</i>"
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes "bopping" is replaced with "kissing".</p>
<p>One common ending has Little Bunny Foo Foo turned into a goon, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun" title="Pun">pun</a> ending "And the moral of the story is: Hare today, goon tomorrow."
	This form of story telling with a pun ending is also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Feghoot" title="Feghoot">feghoot</a>.
